# idlesbot

This is a silly bot that will essentially roll a dice, and depending on the roll, post a Tweet containing a lyric from the band IDLES. You could change the list of source lyrics to your favourite band, if you so wished.

The bot requires the following environment variables to be set. These can be found in your Twitter developer account.

export API_KEY=
export API_SECRET_KEY=
export ACCESS_TOKEN=
export ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=

### Deployment

You could run this on a timed cronjob, or on a Heroku scheduler or, whatever.
